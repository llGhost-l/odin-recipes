<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This recipe describes how to make classic ground beef tacos with a flavorful, seasoned filling and fresh toppings. 
    It's a simple, customizable meal that is perfect for a weeknight dinner. </p>

    <h2>Core Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Mexican Chorizo: The main ingredient, often sold in ground or link form. 
            If it's in links, remove the casing before cooking. </li>
        <li>Tortillas: Typically corn tortillas, though flour can also be used. </li>
        <li>White or Red Onion: Finely diced for a sharp, fresh contrast to the rich chorizo. </li>
        <li>Cilantro: Freshly chopped for a bright, herbaceous flavor. </li>
        <li>Lime: Sliced into wedges for a final squeeze of acidity. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Toppings</h2>
    <ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Avocado</li>
            <li>Queso Fresco</li>
            <li>Lime Wedges</li>
            <li>Salsa</li>
        </ol>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
        <li>Cook the Chorizo: Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
            Add the chorizo and cook, using a spatula to break it apart into smaller pieces. </li>
        <li>Add Aromatics: Once the chorizo is mostly browned, add the diced white onion 
            and poblano pepper to the skillet. </li>
        <li>Finish Cooking: Continue to cook the chorizo and vegetables until the chorizo is fully cooked and browned, 
            and the onions are softened, about 8-10 minutes total.</li>
        <li> Warm the Tortillas: While the chorizo cooks, heat the tortillas in a separate dry skillet 
            or on a gas burner until pliable and lightly charred. </li>
            <li>Serve: Top with diced onion, cilantro, and serve with lime wedges and other desired toppings. </li>

    </ul>
