            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Camarones a la diabla are a classic Mexican dish of shrimp simmered in a spicy, smoky, and 
                flavorful red chile and tomato sauce, often with a hint of sweetness and garlic. </p>

                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dried chiles: I use a combination of guajillo and de arbol chilies and pasilla, ancho, and/or New Mexico for added complexity.</li>
                    <li>Crushed tomatoes: Canned crushed tomatoes are fine here.</li>
                    <li>Onion: You can use white or yellow onion.</li>
                    <li>Garlic: Fresh garlic is key here. Don't substitute garlic powder or granulated garlic.</li>
                    <li>Salt: Don't be tempted to leave out the salt as it is essential for providing depth and balance.</li>
                    <li>Olive oil: Use a nice, flavorful olive oil if you have one.</li>
                    <li>Shrimp: I prefer medium or large shrimp.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Stem and deseed the chiles then cover them with boiling water.</li>
                    <li>Remove the chiles from the water and put them in a blender or food processor with the tomatoes, onion, garlic, 
                        and salt and process until smooth, adding a bit of water or the reserved chile soaking water as needed.</li>
                        <li>Sear the shrimp in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
                        <li>Add the sauce to the shrimp in the skillet, toss to coat, and then simmer until the sauce is bubbling and thickens a bit.</li>
                </ol>
